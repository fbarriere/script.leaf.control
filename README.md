# Description:

This is a Kodi (https://kodi.tv/) addon to control your Leaf (electric
vehicle from Nissan) from the Kodi interface.

It can report you charge level, estimated range, connection status.
You can also start and stop the climate control and start the charge
from the Kodi interface.

# Configuration:

Your Nissan login and password must be defined in the configuration page.

# Remarks:

As the commands go through a remote server and are asynchronous, there
is a latency between the command and the feedback. So be patient...

# Bugs:

There is an error reported when stopping the climate control. This exception
is generated by the underlying library and does not prevent the command from
being executed.

# Feedback and translation:

Use github to report bugs and propose translations.
